Decentralized Twitter Platform

This project is a decentralized, blockchain-based Twitter-inspired platform, built with Solidity and utilizing the Ethereum blockchain. 

Users can create profiles, post tweets, and like/unlike other tweets, all while ensuring decentralized ownership and verifiability of the content. Key functionalities include:

1) User Profiles: Each user can create a profile that includes a display name and bio.
2) Tweet Management: Users can post tweets, with a limit of 280 characters per tweet. Tweets are timestamped and associated with the userâ€™s Ethereum address.
3) Like/Unlike Feature: Users can like or unlike tweets from other users, with each tweet maintaining an updated count of likes.
4) Access Control: An onlyRegistered modifier ensures that only registered users with valid profiles can interact with tweets.
5) Owner Control: The platform owner can adjust the maximum tweet length, using the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin for secure access control.
